# Open-GL Raster Based Graphics Pipeline

## The following stages are implemented
1. Stage 1: modeling transformation
2. Stage 2: view transformation
3. Stage 3: projection transformation
4. Stage 4: clipping & scan conversion using Z-buffer algorithm

There will be two input files: scene.txt and config.txt

The program will output five files: stage1.txt, stage2.txt, stage3.txt and z-buffer.txt, out.bmp. 
The first three files will contain the output of the first three stages, respectively. The fourth file will contain z-buffer values (only those which are less than the max value). 
And the fifth file will be a bmp image generated by the pipeline.

# Scene description:
The first input file is named “scene.txt”. This will contain the following lines:
Line 1: eyeX eyeY eyeZ
Line 2: lookX lookY lookZ
Line 3: upX upY upZ
Line 4: fovY aspectRatio near far

Lines 1-3 of scene.txt state the parameters of the `gluLookAt` function and Line 4 provides the `gluPerspective` parameters.
The display code contains 7 commands as follows:
1. `triangle` command – this command is followed by three lines specifying the coordinates
of the three points of the triangle to be drawn. The points being p1, p2, and p3, 9 double
values, i.e., `p1.x, p1.y, p1.z, p2.x, p2.y, p2.z, p3.x, p3.y, and p3.z` indicate the coordinates.
This is equivalent to the following in OpenGL code.
```
glBegin(GL_TRIANGLE);{
	glVertex3f(p1.x, p1.y, p1.z);
	glVertex3f(p2.x, p2.y, p2.z);
	glVertex3f(p3.x, p3.y, p3.z);
}glEnd();
```
2. `translate` command – this command is followed by 3 double values `(tx, ty, and tz)` in the next line indicating translation amounts along X, Y, and Z axes. This is equivalent to `glTranslatef(tx, ty, tz)` in OpenGL.
3. `scale` command – this command is followed by 3 double values `(sx, sy, and sz)` in the next line indicating scaling factors along X, Y, and Z axes. This is equivalent to `glScalef(sx, sy, sz)` in OpenGL.
4. `rotate` command – this command is followed by 4 double values in the next line indicating the rotation angle in degree (`angle`) and the components of the vector defining the axis of rotation `(ax, ay, and az)`. This is equivalent to `glRotatef(angle, ax, ay, az)` in OpenGL.
5. `push` command – This is equivalent to `glPushMatrix` in OpenGL.
6. `pop` command – This is equivalent to `glPopMatrix` in OpenGL.
7. `end` command – This indicates the end of the display code.

# Config Description
1. The first Line of file contains two integers, representing Screen_Width and Screen_Height respectively.
2. The second line contains a -ve number which specifies the left limit of X. You can get the right limit of X by negating this value.
3. The third line contains a -ve number which specifies the bottom limit of Y. You can get the top limit of Y by negating this value.
4. The fourth line contains two real numbers denoting front and rear limits of Z respectively.
5. Example:
```
500 500
-1.00
-1.00
0.00 2.00
```
6. Visual representation of the configuration according to the aforementioned example:

# Stage 3 Description
The stage3.txt file generated by the program will contain each triangle information as three lines specifying the coordinates of the three points of the triangle. Suppose, the there is only one triangle and the file contains the following:
```
0.50 0.00 0.50
-0.50 0.00 0.50
0.00 0.50 0.50
```
The triangle position can be shown by the following figure within the viewing volume.
